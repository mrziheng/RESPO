cfEeleP.py: calculate VRE LCOE according to CapEx, O&M cost, and annual capacity factor;

InitData.py: initialize input data for RESPO model;

InitMultipleYearCell.py: process inter-annual capacity factor to meet the model running requirement, i.e. used in "Two-year Period" scenario;

InitScenario.py: Initialize parameters to corresponding scenarios;

Main.py: RESPO model for 2060;
